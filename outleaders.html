	<h4>Me being an OUT leader, I aspire in refining and mentoring the youth in a way that will create internal and external growth. Us OUT leaders deeply value nurturing our kids and keeping positive and strong relationships with our participants. Many kids don't have many role models or positive influences so we feel it's important that we fill that void. Background checks are a vital requirement of becoming an OUT leader. Effective screening of our mentors reassures us that we have the right type of adults assisting and aiding our kids. Also, we are ex-offender friendly because we believe that a lot of troubled youth put more trust in people they can relate to. We want to inspire our kids to commit to self-improvement and work towards their goals in life.</h4>
